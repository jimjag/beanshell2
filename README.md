This is the fork of [beanshell.org](http://www.beanshell.org/) called Beanshell2 which lived between 2011 and
2014 at [code.google.com](https://code.google.com/p/beanshell2). The motivation of the fork was that the
original author of Beanshell was no longer maintaining it.

In 2015 the repository moved to GitHub when Google retired their code hosting site. It ended up at [github.com/beanshell2](https://github.com/pejobo/beanshell2).

At a point in time, the old version was rebooted and semi-maintained at [github.com/beanshell](https://github.com/beanshell). There was some
ongoing effort to integrate the changes and improvements made to the project there. 

Unfortunately, both Beanshell and Beanshell2 kind of stagnated, with Beanshell working on a major refactoring, but with 2.0b6 still the only
"official" release.

So this is actually a fork of the Beanshell2 fork. The goal is to provide an alternative to those who are using, and need, 2.0b6 but
also include the various improvements that were folded into the Beanshell2 project. Basically, the intent is to be the new home
of Beanshell (version 2.0).

This fork is licensed [Apache License, version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). It is based on
Beanshell 2.0b6, which is licensed ALv2, and all patches/contributions to Beanshell2 were also under ALv2.
